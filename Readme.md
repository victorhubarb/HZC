# HZC 

Skate blog containing tips, videos, arts, best places to skate and even purchases of some of the products contained in the blog.

## Project Description

Skate blog developed from a previously thought layout and delivered designed in Figma, so that it could be put in code and become a web page. Project created mostly using flexbox and grid and briefly using the click event in JavaScript just to transition the menu in the responsive and mobile format of the page.

## Demo

## Project Features

- Relate flexbox to familiar ways of positioning elements
- See flexbox and its properties for positioning elements
- Produce the header using flexbox tools
- Identify flexbox limitations
- Differentiate flexbox from grid
- Prototype a card layout using basic grid properties
- Recognize in the figma layout what can be part of a grid
- Associate the new properties with the existing structure in the project
- See how the current layout behaves on a different device
- Solve problems with new grid properties
- Produce the rest of the layout with new grid properties
- Identify issues such as: code repetition, maintenance and units of measure
- Understand the advantages of using the grid approach
- Plan how to build the other pages of the project using the techniques learned

## Project Startup

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/victorhubarb/HZC
```

## Future Implementations

Project sent by Figma contains other pages of the project, which are in the navigation menu of the main page but have not yet been created, such as the part of ''Picos'' where you can find tips on the best places to skate. I have the page layout in hand as well as other pages of the same project, but I haven't put it to work yet, which will be the future step.
